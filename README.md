This script identifies centers and sizes of nano-particles in an atomic force microscopy (AFM) image. The Matlab script named AFM0_ellipse.m takes in an AFM data file, such as 'La_0.csv', then subtracts off a non-physical polynomial background. The script assigns indicators to small grains in the image to fit the center and 2D area of each grain, assuming an elliptical shape. Combined with the height, the volume of each grain is obtained such that one can plot the grain number counts as a function of grain volume. Note one should use the proper size of the AFM tip to apply this script correctly.
